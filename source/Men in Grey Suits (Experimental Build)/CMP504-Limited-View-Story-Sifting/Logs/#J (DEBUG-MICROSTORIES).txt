         * MARXIST STUDENT: #K.
         Later, in 7.07pm, the downstairs: #J is talking with #C, #K.
         They are making small talk about The Ashes.
         #K, not really paying attention to whatever #J just said, segues to divulging that {MARXIST STUDENT} was in a Marxist reading group back at Balliol.
         #J can tell #K is lying about #H being the 'MARXIST STUDENT' in their midst (this is actually #K themself!).
         The conversation takes place openly. Still, no one overhears.
         * MARXIST STUDENT: #H.
         Later, in 7.24pm, the dining room: #I is talking with #O.
         They are pondering why we've all been convened here tonight.
         #I segues to spreading that several party grandees - {GRANDEE #1} and {GRANDEE #2} amongst them - are losing confidence in {#a} (a rumour hitherto unheard by #J).
         #J knows #I is supposedly loyal to #F.
         The conversation takes place one-on-one. Still, #J overhears.
         * #a: #a.
         * GRANDEE #1: #A.
         * GRANDEE #2: #F.
         Later, in 7.34pm, the kitchens: #J is talking with #A, #B, #G, #H.
         They are grumbling about the recent weather.
         #A segues to fretting about the next round of 'Home Office Hearings'.
         The conversation takes place behind closed doors, with no one else around. No one overhears.
